# PyTorch test script
This is a (slightly altered) run-through of the pytorn recurrent neural network tutorial that can be found at https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/char_rnn_classification_tutorial.html.

The most significant changes are I slightly altered the namespace to be more logical/explicit and added in some random musings to myself.
